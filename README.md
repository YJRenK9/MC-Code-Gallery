# MC-Code-Gallery

Now that you learned how to create variables and if/else statements, it's time to apply it to creating your website.  But not just any website, an ICSpark project about Minecraft.  There are many possibilities of implementing Minecraft coding references to a website, but for the sake of this project, we'll just stick with an Entity Gallery and Overworld Layers.

I'd like to give you a warning that this project is pretty lengthy and requires the repetition of creating variables.  Hence, why this project is divided into 3 parts.  Not to mention, images will also guide you for this instructions file.  

## Objectives

Use **JavaScript** to display text and manipulate elements on webpages.  Also, use HTML and CSS to display annd format images on webpages.
  1. Create a gallery of Entity data types
  2. Create a gallery of Game Rule data types
  3. Create another webpage that lets the user click on the arrow buttons to change the vertical position along with the Minecraft environment
