Minecraft is a good game for kids (and adults) to play.  It unlocks the potential of the player's creativity to do many amazing things.  Not to mention, one can apply both coding and art in Minecraft.  Creating data packs and texture packs are examples.  I believe Minecraft is the bridge that connects kids to coding.  Coding itself is alright.  However, applying it to games or any creative medium would make kids and young adults more interested in coding.  It would benefit visual learners as well.  If one wants to make coding more fun, one would have to apply it to creativity.  In other words, one would be good at the technical and artistic aspects of coding.
